# Introducing Tidyverse

[**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.

## Core Tidyverse Packages

-   [**dplyr**](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges.

-   [**tidyr**](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) helps R users to create tidy data.

-   [**stringr**](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/) provides a cohesive set of functions designed to make working with strings as easy as possible.

-   [**forcats**](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/) provides a suite of tools that solve common problems with factors, including changing the order of levels or the values.

-   [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) provides a fast and friendly way to read rectangular data (like csv, tsv, and fwf).

-   [**tibble**](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) is a modern reimagining of the data.frame, keeping what time has proven to be effective, and throwing out what is not.

-   [**ggplot2**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics.

-   [**purrr**](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/) enhances R\'s functional programming (FP) toolkit by providing a complete and consistent set of tools for working with functions and vectors.

## Data Science Workflow with Tidyverse

## Getting Started

### Installing and loading the required libraries 

Before we get started, it is important for us to ensure that the required R packages have been installed. If yes, we will load the R packages. If they have yet to be installed, we will install the R packages and load them onto R environment.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse)
```

::: callout-note
The code chunk on the right assumes that you already have [**pacman**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pacman/index.html) package installed. If not, please go ahead install pacman first.
:::

### Importing Data

-   The code chunk below imports *exam_data.csv* into R environment by using [*read_csv()*](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) function of [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package.

-   **readr** is one of the tidyverse package.

```{r}
exam_data <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

-   Year end examination grades of a cohort of primary 3 students from a local school.

-   There are a total of seven attributes. Four of them are categorical data type and the other three are in continuous data type.

    -   The categorical attributes are: ID, CLASS, GENDER and RACE.

    -   The continuous attributes are: MATHS, ENGLISH and SCIENCE.

# Introducing ggplot

-   An R package for **declaratively** creating **data-driven** graphics based on ***The Grammar of Graphics***

-   It is part of the tidyverse family specially designed for visual exploration and communication.

-   For more detail, visit [ggplot2 link](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/index.html).

## R Graphics VS ggplot

#### R Graphics

```{r}
hist(exam_data$MATHS)
```

#### ggplot2

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=10, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="black", 
                 fill="grey") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores")
```
