## **Overview**

Proportional symbol maps (also known as graduate symbol maps) are a class of maps that use the visual variable of size to represent differences in the magnitude of a discrete, abruptly changing phenomenon, e.g.Â counts of people. Like choropleth maps, you can create classed or unclassed versions of these maps. The classed ones are known as range-graded or graduated symbols, and the unclassed are called proportional symbols, where the area of the symbols are proportional to the values of the attribute being mapped. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create a proportional symbol map showing the number of wins by Singapore Pools\' outlets using an R package called **tmap**.

### **Learning outcome**

By the end of this hands-on exercise, you will acquire the following skills by using appropriate R packages:

-   To import an aspatial data file into R.

-   To convert it into simple point feature data frame and at the same time, to assign an appropriate projection reference to the newly create simple point feature data frame.

-   To plot interactive proportional symbol maps.

## **Getting Started**

Before we get started, we need to ensure that **tmap** package of R and other related R packages have been installed and loaded into R.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, tmap, tidyverse)
```
