## **Learning Outcome**

By the end of this hands-on exercise you will be able create the followings data visualisation by using R packages:

-   plotting a calender heatmap by using ggplot2 functions,

-   plotting a cycle plot by using ggplot2 function,

-   plotting a horizon chart

## **Getting Started**

```{r}
pacman::p_load(scales, viridis, lubridate, ggthemes, gridExtra, tidyverse, readxl, knitr, data.table)
```

## **Plotting Calendar Heatmap**

In this section, you will learn how to plot a calender heatmap programmetically by using ggplot2 package.\

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   plot a calender heatmap by using ggplot2 functions and extension,

-   to write function using R programming,

-   to derive specific date and time related field by using base R and lubridate packages

-   to perform data preparation task by using tidyr and dplyr packages.

### **The Data**

For the purpose of this hands-on exercise, *eventlog.csv* file will be used. This data file consists of 199,999 rows of time-series cyber attack records by country.

### **Importing the data**

First, you will use the code chunk below to import *eventlog.csv* file into R environment and called the data frame as *attacks*.
