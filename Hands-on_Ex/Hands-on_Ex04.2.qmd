## Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates

-   A point estimate is a single number, such as a mean.

-   Uncertainty is expressed as standard error, confidence interval, or credible interval

-   Important:

    -   Don\'t confuse the uncertainty of a point estimate with the variation in the sample

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, plotly, crosstalk, DT, ggdist, gganimate, ggpubr)
```

```{r}
exam <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

### Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggplot2 methods

The code chunk below performs the followings:

-   group the observation by RACE,

-   computes the count of observations, mean, standard deviation and standard error of Maths by RACE, and

-   save the output as a tibble data table called `my_sum`.

```{r}
my_sum <- exam %>%
  group_by(RACE) %>%
  summarise(
    n=n(),
    mean=mean(MATHS),
    sd=sd(MATHS)
    ) %>%
  mutate(se=sd/sqrt(n-1))
```

Note: For the mathematical explanation, please refer to Slide 20 of Lesson 4.

Next, the code chunk below will

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(my_sum), format = 'html')
```

### Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggplot2 methods

The code chunk below is used to reveal the standard error of mean maths score by race.

```{r}
ggplot(my_sum) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(x=RACE, 
        ymin=mean-se, 
        ymax=mean+se), 
    width=0.2, 
    colour="black", 
    alpha=0.9, 
    size=0.5) +
  geom_point(aes
           (x=RACE, 
            y=mean), 
           stat="identity", 
           color="red",
           size = 1.5,
           alpha=1) +
  ggtitle("Standard error of mean 
          maths score by rac")
```

### Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: **ggplot2** methods

```{r}
ggplot(my_sum) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(x=reorder(RACE,-mean), 
        ymin=mean-se, 
        ymax=mean+se), 
    width=0.2, 
    colour="black", 
    alpha=0.95, 
    size=0.5) +
  geom_point(aes
           (x=RACE, 
            y=mean), 
           stat="identity", 
           color="red",
           size = 1.5,
           alpha=1) +
  ggtitle("95% confidence interval of mean maths score by race")
```

### Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates with interactive error bars

```{r}
p <- ggplot(my_sum) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(x=reorder(RACE,-mean), 
        ymin=mean-se, 
        ymax=mean+se), 
    width=0.2, 
    colour="black", 
    alpha=0.99, 
    size=0.5) +
  geom_point(aes
           (x=RACE, 
            y=mean), 
           stat="identity", 
           color="red",
           size = 1.5,
           alpha=1) +
  ggtitle("99% confidence interval of mean maths score by race")

pp <- highlight(ggplotly(p))

d <- highlight_key(my_sum)

crosstalk::bscols(pp,
                  DT::datatable(d))
```

## Visualising Uncertainty: **ggdist** package

-   [**ggdist**](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/) is an R package that provides a flexible set of ggplot2 geoms and stats designed especially for visualising distributions and uncertainty.

-   It is designed for both frequentist and Bayesian uncertainty visualization, taking the view that uncertainty visualization can be unified through the perspective of distribution visualization:

    -   for frequentist models, one visualises confidence distributions or bootstrap distributions (see vignette(\"freq-uncertainty-vis\"));

    -   for Bayesian models, one visualises probability distributions (see the tidybayes package, which builds on top of ggdist).

### Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: **ggdist** methods

In the code chunk below, [`stat_pointinterval()`](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/reference/stat_pointinterval.html) of **ggdist** is used to build a visual for displaying distribution of maths scores by race.

```{r}
exam %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, 
             y = MATHS)) +
  stat_pointinterval() +   #<<
  labs(
    title = "Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score",
    subtitle = "Mean Point + Multiple-interval plot")
```

Gentle advice: This function comes with many arguments, students are advised to read the syntax reference for more detail.

```{r}
exam %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, y = MATHS)) +
  stat_pointinterval(.width = 0.95,
  .point = median,
  .interval = qi) +
  labs(
    title = "Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score",
    subtitle = "Mean Point + Multiple-interval plot")
```

    show.legend = FALSE) +   
  labs(
    title = "Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score",
    subtitle = "Mean Point + Multiple-interval plot")
```

             y = MATHS)) +
  stat_gradientinterval(   
    fill = "skyblue",      
    show.legend = TRUE     
  ) +                        
  labs(
    title = "Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score",
    subtitle = "Gradient + interval plot")
```

## Visualizing Uncertainty with Hypothetical Outcome Plots (HOPs)

Step 1: Installing ungeviz package

```{r}
devtools::install_github("wilkelab/ungeviz")
```

Note: You only need to perform this step once.

Step 2: Launch the application in R

```{r}
library(ungeviz)

ggplot(data = exam, 
       (aes(x = factor(RACE), y = MATHS))) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(
    height = 0.3, width = 0.05), 
    size = 0.4, color = "#0072B2", alpha = 1/2) +
  geom_hpline(data = sampler(25, group = RACE), height = 0.6, color = "#D55E00") +
  theme_bw() + 
  # `.draw` is a generated column indicating the sample draw
  transition_states(.draw, 1, 3)
```

                             group = RACE), 
              height = 0.6, 
              color = "#D55E00") +
  theme_bw() +
