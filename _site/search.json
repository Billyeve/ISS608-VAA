Examples include:\n\ngeom_point for drawing individual points (e.g., a scatter plot)\ngeom_line for drawing lines (e.g., for a line charts)\ngeom_smooth for drawing smoothed lines (e.g., for simple trends or approximations)\ngeom_bar for drawing bars (e.g., for bar charts)\ngeom_histogram for drawing binned values (e.g. a histogram)\ngeom_polygon for drawing arbitrary shapes\ngeom_map for drawing polygons in the shape of a map!

    "text": "Visualization Critique\nThe issues of the original visualization are as follows: \n\nClarity\n\na. Lack of Header and Titles\nThere is no title to explain the context of the visual. Users would not know the message of the visual at first glance. While an age sex pyramid is a common visual tool to indicate a split in gender population, it is not clear which population is being discussed unless the user is aware of the Planning Areas. Furthermore, though indicated as 2022 at the x-axis, it would have been clearer if it is included in the header or title. A simple title such as 2022 Singapore Age – Sex Pyramid would be enough to communicate the topic of the visual.\n\n\nb. Lack of Color Labels\nThe color of the back-to-back horizontal bar chart is the same between male and female values. This may confuse users as it may give the wrong impression that both bars may belong to a single elongated bar. It is proposed that color for both male and female to be separate and distinct, even if in the terms of different shade. \n\n\n\nAesthetic\n\nc. Poor Layout\nThe Trellis chart is organized horizontally and side by side and as such is visually difficult to read as there is an estimated 55 Planning Areas to scroll from. This difficult extends also to comparing multiple charts as there is only so much that can be shown per plane. It is recommended to create a table like trellis chart with rows and columns as to ease visualization and maximize space. \n\n\nd. Lack of differentiating color per Area\nSimilar to the back to back horizontal bar, the color between planning areas are also the same. To improve aesthetic, it is recommended that Planning Areas will have the same color while male to female bars with share the same color but of different shades.\n\n\ne. Too many Age Groups\nThe is an overall 19 age gaps that extends the chart and limits the number of planes that can be shown per window. It is recommended to group together the different age groups from 5 years to 10 years thus reducing the y axis by half and increase the number of charts that can be seen in one viewing. \n\n\n\nInteractive\nThere is an opportunity to create filters to limit and focus the dashboard to a select Area, Subzone and Dwelling Type. This opportunity can allow for a more interactive and dynamic analysis."

Proper Titles and Headers\nThe Age-Sex Pyramid Trellis Chart is titled correctly, indicating as 2022 Singapore Age-Sex Pyramid per Area. Furthermore, each Age-Sex Pyramid is labeled per Planning Area at the bottom right-hand corner of each plane. These labels ensure that users can properly read and identify the overall message of the chart and category of each individual pyramid. \nIt may be recommended to add value labels per bar to textually visualize the amount each chart, yet this step can be avoid as the chart allows for pop out labels and values to appear when hovering over the chart. Furthermore, on the design aspect, value labels will clutter the chart and cause it to be overly noisy. \n\n\nb. Differentiated Color Labels\nMale-Female bar colors are identified with different shades with the lighter colors indicating male and darker as female. This ensures visual differentiation between genders with ensuring some similarity within planning area.\n\n\n\nAesthetic\n\nc. 3 Column Tabular Trellis Chart\nThe Trellis Chart is organized to 3 columns to ensure that the pyramids are visually maximized both in terms of the number of pyramid charts in one viewing and the max value of the y-axis for the bars to be visually district.\n\n\nd. Differentiating Color per Area\nColors per Planning Area is colored differently to ensure distinct differentiation per pyramid. \n\n\ne. Simplified Age Groups\n19 age groups are reduced to 10 age groups to visually maximize the space of the plane without oversimplifying the data points. \n\n\n\nInteractive\nThe Trellis Chart can be filtered per Planning Area, Subzone and Type of Dwelling. This ensures interactive use of the chart and allow for more drilled down analysis of the data. Though there is a limitation as this chart cannot compare Subzones within the same Planning Area as can be an improvement for future developments."

Male population is 11 million while Female is 11.5 million. This is a stark contrast from previous years as there are more males in Singapore than females, average ratio at 53% male and 47% female. The shift in population shares maybe due to migration and the impact of COVID lockdown as male manpower migrating to the city state decreased during COVID and has not recovered since. \nMale and Female distribution per Planning Area and age group are almost equal except for the senior population. The close distribution maybe due to the equal economic opportunity for both genders in Singapore. Furthermore, top areas that are heavily populated by males are populated by females as well. \nThe data may be incomplete as 26 out of 55 (48%) of Total Planning Area have either no data or negligible data. This is evident that some area’s population data is missing and is not only limited to far east and far west areas such as Tuas, but high population city center such as Orchard has no data recorded as well. \n\nDashboard Link: https://public.tableau.com/views/DataVizMakeover01_16743910439700/TotalSingapore?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link"

The output is to recreate a Trellis Chart Age-Sex Pyramid through R-Studios by using ggplot2, ggplot2 extensions and tidyverse packages.\nThe visualization is created using the Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Sub-zone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2022 (Singstat).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe output should be focused as a static Trellis Chart without filter interactivity.\n\n\n\n\nThe Original Visualization Source: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/joseph.zexeong.tan/viz/SingaporePopulationPyramindJun2022v1_3/trel3x3_d?publish=yes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Original Visualization shows 2 separate Age-Pyramid Trellis Chart that shows the same message. Two sets of visualization normally indicate that they visualize two different messages that may it be independent of each other or connected. The issue with the dashboard is that both sets indicate the same message just in a different format. This raises either confusion to the reader and a form of redundancy that can be best allocated to something else.\n3x3 Trellis Chart limits the visualization to only 9 Age-Sex Pyramids. Limited and focused visualizations are normally selected under a criteria. This criteria may be in terms of highest population cumulative or selective. The original visualization shows no indication of the criteria chosen to only visualize 9 areas and may only be concluded as a random selection.\n3x3 Trellis Chart lacks y-axis labels. Taking to consideration that the Trellis Charts is a stand alone visualization, the lack of y-axis label reduces the clarity of the y-axis values. Furthermore, both Trellis Charts lack x-axis values and labels but make up for it through text values per bar. In terms of clarity, one can argue that the lack of x-axis may confuse the reader due to the text values having no reference while others say the taxt vales are enough to compensate the lack of x-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\nText Values center bar alignment makes reading the values difficult. Due to the mismatched alignment of the text values brought abut by the central alignment placement in the bar chart makes reading the values difficult as the reader cannot simply scroll down and read the values, not mention creates unnecessary confusion in the graph.\nText Values on each Bar Chart overwhelms the visualization. More than the mismatch alignment, the number of the text values in the chart saturates the charts and makes it “noisy”. The text values fill the dashboard with a lot of numbers that is makes the labels and visuals difficult to look at and interpret.\nHorizontally arranged Trellis Chart limits and squeezes the Age-Sex Pyramids. This visualization arrangement artificially contorts the bar length due to the lack of width space. The squeeze minimizes the visual differentiation between bar charts as such creates an illusion that some bars are of the same size."

Not to mention that axis labels and ticks are present to further provide clarity.\nDue to the limitation of space, a 3x3 Trellis Chart may be the maximum representation that can at least maximize readability. Adding more Age-Sex Pyramids will diminish readability and make the chart more difficult to interpret. Furthermore, the limits in size also affects the font sizes, thus reducing clarity and readability.\n\n\n\nAesthetic\n\nThe removal of bar numbers lessens the elements present in the visualization and makes in more pleasing to look at. This less “noisy” visualization greatly improves its aesthetic and design.\n\n\n\nInteractivity\n\nCrafting the visualization in R Studios is more difficult and restrictive as the limits in visual size restrict creative and engaging visuals. Furthermore, transitioning to interactivity may be difficult in the future as the limitations may complicate it further. Future visualization may be better crafted in R Shiny instead of quarto/R Studios."
