It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat's because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as\n\n\n\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.\n\n\n\nHow to interpret Bayes Factor\nA Bayes Factor can be any positive number.

There are several ggplot2 extensions provide functions to compose figure with multiple graphs. In this section, I am going to shared with you patchwork.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily. Here’s the general syntax that combines: - Two-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +. - Parenthesis () to create a subplot group. - Two-Row Layout using the Division Sign \\\n\n\n\nWorking with patchwork\n\np1 + p2 / p3\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwill place the plots beside each other, while / will stack them.\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more about, refer to Plot Assembly.\npatchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities, in order to identify subplots in text:\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\npatchwork <- (p1 / p2) | p3\npatchwork & theme_economist()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout. With inset_element() of patchwork, we can place one or several plots or graphic elements freely on top or below another plot.\n\np3 + inset_element(p2, \n                   left = 0.02, \n                   bottom = 0.7, \n                   right = 0.5, \n                   top = 1)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'"

    "text": "Interactive Data Visualisation - ggiraph methods\n\nggiraph is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\n\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nOnclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\nData_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.\n\nIf it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides. Refer to this article for more detail explanation.\n\n\nTooltip effect with tooltip aesthetic\nBelow shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an ggplot object will be created. Next, girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive svg object.\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractivity: By hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID will be displayed.\n\n\nComparing ggplot2 and ggiraph codes\nThe original ggplot2 code chunk.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot(binwidth=2.5, \n               dotsize = 0.5) +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\n\n\n\n\nThe ggiraph code chunk.\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              #<<\n    aes(tooltip = ID),                   #<<\n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  #<<\n    binwidth = 1,                        #<<\n    method = \"histodot\") +               #<<\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  #<<\n  ggobj = p,                             #<<\n  width_svg = 6,                         #<<\n  height_svg = 6*0.618                   #<<   \n)                                        #<<\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that two steps are involved. First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive()) will be used to create the basic graph. Then, girafe() will be used to generate an svg object to be displayed on an html page.\n\n\nDisplaying multiple information on tooltip\nThe content of the tooltip can be customised by including a list object as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nexam_data$tooltip <- c(paste0(     #<<\n  \"Name = \", exam_data$ID,         #<<\n  \"\\n Class = \", exam_data$CLASS)) #<<\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = exam_data$tooltip), #<<\n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 8,\n  height_svg = 8*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractivity: By hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID and Class will be displayed.\nThe first three lines of codes in the code chunk create a new field called tooltip. At the same time, it populates text in ID and CLASS fields into the newly created field. Next, this newly created field is used as tooltip field as shown in the code of line 7.\n\n\nCustomising Tooltip style\nCode chunk below uses opts_tooltip() of ggiraph to customize tooltip rendering by add css declarations.\n\ntooltip_css <- \"background-color:white; #<<\nfont-style:bold; color:black;\" #<<\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(tooltip = ID),                   \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(    #<<\n    opts_tooltip(    #<<\n      css = tooltip_css)) #<<\n)                                        \n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the background colour of the tooltip is black and the font colour is white and bold.\n\nRefer to Customizing girafe objects to learn more about how to customise ggiraph objects.\n\n\n\nDisplaying statistics on tooltip\n\ntooltip <- function(y, ymax, accuracy = .01) {   #<<\n  mean <- scales::number(y, accuracy = accuracy) #<<\n  sem <- scales::number(ymax - y, accuracy = accuracy) #<<\n  paste(\"Mean maths scores:\", mean, \"+/-\", sem) #<<\n} #<<\n\ngg_point <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n                   aes(x = RACE),\n) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = MATHS, \n                   tooltip = after_stat(  #<<\n                     tooltip(y, ymax))),  #<<\n    fun.data = \"mean_se\", \n    geom = GeomInteractiveCol,  #<<\n    fill = \"light blue\"\n  ) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = MATHS),\n    fun.data = mean_se,\n    geom = \"errorbar\", width = 0.2, size = 0.2\n  )\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\ngirafe(ggobj = gg_point,\n       width_svg = 8,\n       height_svg = 8*0.618)\n\n\n\n\n\nCode chunk on the left shows an advanced way to customise tooltip. In this example, a function is used to compute 90% confident interval of the mean. The derived statistics are then displayed in the tooltip.\n\n\nHover effect with data_id aesthetic\nCode chunk below show the second interactive feature of ggiraph, namely data_id.\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(           \n    aes(data_id = CLASS),             #<<\n    stackgroups = TRUE,               \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618                      \n)                                        \n\n\n\n\n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over.\nNote that the default value of the hover css is hover_css = “fill:orange;”.\n\n\nStyling hover effect\nIn the code chunk below, css codes are used to change the highlighting effect.\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(data_id = CLASS),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(                        #<<\n    opts_hover(css = \"fill: #202020;\"),  #<<\n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\") #<<\n  )                                      #<<  \n)                                        \n\n\n\n\n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over.\nNote: Different from Slide 9, in this example the ccs customisation request are encoded directly.\n\n\nCombining tooltip and hover effect\nThere are time that we want to combine tooltip and hover effect on the interactive statistical graph as shown in the code chunk below.\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(tooltip = CLASS, #<<\n        data_id = CLASS),#<<              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(                        \n    opts_hover(css = \"fill: #202020;\"),  \n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\") \n  )                                        \n)                                        \n\n\n\n\n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over.

(1999) Grammar of Graphics, Springer.\nThe grammar of graphics is an answer to a question:\n\n\nWhat is a statistical graphic?\n\nGrammar of graphics defines the rules of structuring mathematical and aesthetic elements into a meaningful graph.\nTwo principles\n\nGraphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements\nMeaningful plots through aesthetic mapping\n\n\n\n\nA good grammar will allow us to gain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics (Cox 1978).\nA grammar provides a strong foundation for understanding a diverse range of graphics.\nA grammar may also help guide us on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like, but there will still be many grammatically correct but nonsensical graphics.\n\n\n\n\nEssential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2\nA Layered Grammar of Graphics\n\nData: The dataset being plotted.\nAesthetics take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.\nGeometrics: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line.\nFacets split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).\nStatistics, statiscal transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).\nCoordinate systems define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.\nThemes modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, or legend background.\n\n\nReference: Hadley Wickham (2010) “A layered grammar of graphics.” Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 3–28.\n\nThe ggplot() function and data argument\n\nLet us call the ggplot() function using the code chunk on the right.\nNotice that a blank canvas appears.\nggplot() initializes a ggplot object.\nThe data argument defines the dataset to be used for plotting.\nIf the dataset is not already a data.frame, it will be converted to one by fortify().\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Aesthetic mappings\n\nThe aesthetic mappings take attributes of the data and and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colour, size, shape, or transparency.\nEach visual characteristic can thus encode an aspect of the data and be used to convey information.\nAll aesthetics of a plot are specified in the aes() function call (in later part of this lesson, you will see that each geom layer can have its own aes specification)\n\n\n\nWorking with aes()\n\nThe code chunk on the right add the aesthetic element into the plot.\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS))\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that ggplot includes the x-axis and the axis’s label.\n\n\n\nGeometric Objects: geom\n\nGeometric objects are the actual marks we put on a plot.

    "text": "Visualization Critique\nThe issues of the original visualization are as follows: \n\nClarity\n\na. Lack of Header and Titles\nThere is no title to explain the context of the visual. Users would not know the message of the visual at first glance. While an age sex pyramid is a common visual tool to indicate a split in gender population, it is not clear which population is being discussed unless the user is aware of the Planning Areas. Furthermore, though indicated as 2022 at the x-axis, it would have been clearer if it is included in the header or title. A simple title such as 2022 Singapore Age – Sex Pyramid would be enough to communicate the topic of the visual.\n\n\nb. Lack of Color Labels\nThe color of the back-to-back horizontal bar chart is the same between male and female values. This may confuse users as it may give the wrong impression that both bars may belong to a single elongated bar. It is proposed that color for both male and female to be separate and distinct, even if in the terms of different shade. \n\n\n\nAesthetic\n\nc. Poor Layout\nThe Trellis chart is organized horizontally and side by side and as such is visually difficult to read as there is an estimated 55 Planning Areas to scroll from. This difficult extends also to comparing multiple charts as there is only so much that can be shown per plane. It is recommended to create a table like trellis chart with rows and columns as to ease visualization and maximize space. \n\n\nd. Lack of differentiating color per Area\nSimilar to the back to back horizontal bar, the color between planning areas are also the same. To improve aesthetic, it is recommended that Planning Areas will have the same color while male to female bars with share the same color but of different shades.\n\n\ne. Too many Age Groups\nThe is an overall 19 age gaps that extends the chart and limits the number of planes that can be shown per window. It is recommended to group together the different age groups from 5 years to 10 years thus reducing the y axis by half and increase the number of charts that can be seen in one viewing. \n\n\n\nInteractive\nThere is an opportunity to create filters to limit and focus the dashboard to a select Area, Subzone and Dwelling Type. This opportunity can allow for a more interactive and dynamic analysis."

Proper Titles and Headers\nThe Age-Sex Pyramid Trellis Chart is titled correctly, indicating as 2022 Singapore Age-Sex Pyramid per Area. Furthermore, each Age-Sex Pyramid is labeled per Planning Area at the bottom right-hand corner of each plane. These labels ensure that users can properly read and identify the overall message of the chart and category of each individual pyramid. \nIt may be recommended to add value labels per bar to textually visualize the amount each chart, yet this step can be avoid as the chart allows for pop out labels and values to appear when hovering over the chart. Furthermore, on the design aspect, value labels will clutter the chart and cause it to be overly noisy. \n\n\nb. Differentiated Color Labels\nMale-Female bar colors are identified with different shades with the lighter colors indicating male and darker as female. This ensures visual differentiation between genders with ensuring some similarity within planning area.\n\n\n\nAesthetic\n\nc. 3 Column Tabular Trellis Chart\nThe Trellis Chart is organized to 3 columns to ensure that the pyramids are visually maximized both in terms of the number of pyramid charts in one viewing and the max value of the y-axis for the bars to be visually district.\n\n\nd. Differentiating Color per Area\nColors per Planning Area is colored differently to ensure distinct differentiation per pyramid. \n\n\ne. Simplified Age Groups\n19 age groups are reduced to 10 age groups to visually maximize the space of the plane without oversimplifying the data points. \n\n\n\nInteractive\nThe Trellis Chart can be filtered per Planning Area, Subzone and Type of Dwelling. This ensures interactive use of the chart and allow for more drilled down analysis of the data. Though there is a limitation as this chart cannot compare Subzones within the same Planning Area as can be an improvement for future developments."

Page 1 of the dashboard is to give an overview of Singapore 2022 population while Page 2 presents the Trellis Chart and Age-Sex Pyramids per Planning Area. \n\n\n\nPage 1\nPage 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor Findings\n\nOverall, Singapore has more females than males by est. 500,000 heavily contributed by the adult (25 and above) age group. Male population is 11 million while Female is 11.5 million. This is a stark contrast from previous years as there are more males in Singapore than females, average ratio at 53% male and 47% female. The shift in population shares maybe due to migration and the impact of COVID lockdown as male manpower migrating to the city state decreased during COVID and has not recovered since. \nMale and Female distribution per Planning Area and age group are almost equal except for the senior population. The close distribution maybe due to the equal economic opportunity for both genders in Singapore. Furthermore, top areas that are heavily populated by males are populated by females as well. \nThe data may be incomplete as 26 out of 55 (48%) of Total Planning Area have either no data or negligible data. This is evident that some area’s population data is missing and is not only limited to far east and far west areas such as Tuas, but high population city center such as Orchard has no data recorded as well. \n\nDashboard Link: https://public.tableau.com/views/DataVizMakeover01_16743910439700/TotalSingapore?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link"

    "text": "The objective of this exercise is to critique and improve an Age-Sex Pyramid Analytic Visualization of Singapore of the year 2022. The output is to recreate a Trellis Chart Age-Sex Pyramid through R-Studios by using ggplot2, ggplot2 extensions and tidyverse packages.\nThe visualization is created using the Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Sub-zone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2022 (Singstat).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe output should be focused as a static Trellis Chart without filter interactivity.\n\n\n\n\nThe Original Visualization Source: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/joseph.zexeong.tan/viz/SingaporePopulationPyramindJun2022v1_3/trel3x3_d?publish=yes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Original Visualization shows 2 separate Age-Pyramid Trellis Chart that shows the same message. Two sets of visualization normally indicate that they visualize two different messages that may it be independent of each other or connected. The issue with the dashboard is that both sets indicate the same message just in a different format. This raises either confusion to the reader and a form of redundancy that can be best allocated to something else.\n3x3 Trellis Chart limits the visualization to only 9 Age-Sex Pyramids. Limited and focused visualizations are normally selected under a criteria. This criteria may be in terms of highest population cumulative or selective. The original visualization shows no indication of the criteria chosen to only visualize 9 areas and may only be concluded as a random selection.\n3x3 Trellis Chart lacks y-axis labels. Taking to consideration that the Trellis Charts is a stand alone visualization, the lack of y-axis label reduces the clarity of the y-axis values. Furthermore, both Trellis Charts lack x-axis values and labels but make up for it through text values per bar. In terms of clarity, one can argue that the lack of x-axis may confuse the reader due to the text values having no reference while others say the taxt vales are enough to compensate the lack of x-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\nText Values center bar alignment makes reading the values difficult. Due to the mismatched alignment of the text values brought abut by the central alignment placement in the bar chart makes reading the values difficult as the reader cannot simply scroll down and read the values, not mention creates unnecessary confusion in the graph.\nText Values on each Bar Chart overwhelms the visualization. More than the mismatch alignment, the number of the text values in the chart saturates the charts and makes it “noisy”. The text values fill the dashboard with a lot of numbers that is makes the labels and visuals difficult to look at and interpret.\nHorizontally arranged Trellis Chart limits and squeezes the Age-Sex Pyramids. This visualization arrangement artificially contorts the bar length due to the lack of width space. The squeeze minimizes the visual differentiation between bar charts as such creates an illusion that some bars are of the same size."

Not to mention that axis labels and ticks are present to further provide clarity.\nDue to the limitation of space, a 3x3 Trellis Chart may be the maximum representation that can at least maximize readability. Adding more Age-Sex Pyramids will diminish readability and make the chart more difficult to interpret. Furthermore, the limits in size also affects the font sizes, thus reducing clarity and readability.\n\n\n\nAesthetic\n\nThe removal of bar numbers lessens the elements present in the visualization and makes in more pleasing to look at. This less “noisy” visualization greatly improves its aesthetic and design.\n\n\n\nInteractivity\n\nCrafting the visualization in R Studios is more difficult and restrictive as the limits in visual size restrict creative and engaging visuals. Furthermore, transitioning to interactivity may be difficult in the future as the limitations may complicate it further. Future visualization may be better crafted in R Shiny instead of quarto/R Studios."

It aims to enhance you working experience of ggplot2 to customise speciallised data visualisation like funnel plot.\n\nComputing the basic derived fields\nTo plot the funnel plot from scratch, we need to derive cumulative death rate and standard error of cumulative death rate.\n\ndf <- covid19 %>%\n  mutate(rate = Death / Positive) %>%\n  mutate(rate.se = sqrt((rate*(1-rate)) / (Positive))) %>%\n  filter(rate > 0)\n\nNext, the fit.mean is computed by using the code chunk below.\n\nfit.mean <- weighted.mean(df$rate, 1/df$rate.se^2)\n\n\n\nCalculate lower and upper limits for 95% and 99.9% CI\nThe code chunk below is used to compute the lower and upper limits for 95% confidence interval.\n\nnumber.seq <- seq(1, max(df$Positive), 1)\nnumber.ll95 <- fit.mean - 1.96 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) \nnumber.ul95 <- fit.mean + 1.96 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) \nnumber.ll999 <- fit.mean - 3.29 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) \nnumber.ul999 <- fit.mean + 3.29 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) \ndfCI <- data.frame(number.ll95, number.ul95, number.ll999, number.ul999, number.seq, fit.mean)\n\n\n\nPlotting a static funnel plot\nIn the code chunk below, ggplot2 functions are used to plot a static funnel plot.\n\np <- ggplot(df, aes(x = Positive, y = rate)) +\n  geom_point(aes(label=`Sub-district`), \n             alpha=0.4) +\n  geom_line(data = dfCI, \n            aes(x = number.seq, \n                y = number.ll95), \n            size = 0.4, \n            colour = \"grey40\", \n            linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_line(data = dfCI, \n            aes(x = number.seq, \n                y = number.ul95), \n            size = 0.4, \n            colour = \"grey40\", \n            linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_line(data = dfCI, \n            aes(x = number.seq, \n                y = number.ll999), \n            size = 0.4, \n            colour = \"grey40\") +\n  geom_line(data = dfCI, \n            aes(x = number.seq, \n                y = number.ul999), \n            size = 0.4, \n            colour = \"grey40\") +\n  geom_hline(data = dfCI, \n             aes(yintercept = fit.mean), \n             size = 0.4, \n             colour = \"grey40\") +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,0.05)) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1, y = -0.13, label = \"95%\", size = 3, colour = \"grey40\") + \n  annotate(\"text\", x = 4.5, y = -0.18, label = \"99%\", size = 3, colour = \"grey40\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Cumulative Fatality Rate by Cumulative Number of COVID-19 Cases\") +\n  xlab(\"Cumulative Number of COVID-19 Cases\") + \n  ylab(\"Cumulative Fatality Rate\") +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=12),\n        legend.position = c(0.91,0.85), \n        legend.title = element_text(size=7),\n        legend.text = element_text(size=7),\n        legend.background = element_rect(colour = \"grey60\", linetype = \"dotted\"),\n        legend.key.height = unit(0.3, \"cm\"))\n\nWarning in geom_point(aes(label = `Sub-district`), alpha = 0.4): Ignoring\nunknown aesthetics: label\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Funnel Plot: plotly + ggplot2\nThe funnel plot created using ggplot2 functions can be made interactive with ggplotly() of plotly r package.\n\nfp_ggplotly <- ggplotly(p,\n  tooltip = c(\"label\", \n              \"x\", \n              \"y\"))\nfp_ggplotly"
