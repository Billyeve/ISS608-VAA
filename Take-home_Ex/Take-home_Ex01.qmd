1.  **OBJECTIVE**

The objective is to create **Age-Sex Pyramid Analytical Visualization** to accurately describe the demographic of Singapore. It is a common visual representation to contrast and subsect the population based on different classifiers, commonly by gender and age. To further illustrate the visualization, multiple Age-Sex Pyramids will be plotted by planning area using the trellis display.Â 

The visualization is created using the ***Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2022 (Singstat).***
