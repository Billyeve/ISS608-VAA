# Objective

The objective is to create **Age-Sex Pyramid Analytic Visualization** to accurately describe the demographic of Singapore. It is a common visual representation to contrast and sub sect the population based on different classifiers, commonly by gender and age. To further illustrate the visualization, multiple Age-Sex Pyramids will be plotted by planning area using the trellis display. 

The visualization is created using the ***Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Sub-zone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2022 (Singstat).***

# Data Cleaning and Preparation 

To ensure that the data is properly loaded and read, the following actions will be done in the raw excel file and tableau. 

+:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+:--------------------------------------------:+
| From the raw excel file, remove the unnecessary rows as not to confuse the tableau reading  | ![](images/image-582415093.png)              |

# Original Visualization 

Trellis Display is a visualization framework aimed at easily presenting visual data in tables and box subdivided by category. The aim is to be able to compare and contrast the data based on the category in one window.

Though the original visualization is a trellis display, there are some issues on the clarity, aesthetics, and interactive design of the original data visualization to be explained at the next section.
